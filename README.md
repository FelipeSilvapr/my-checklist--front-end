# My Checklist — front-end ✅

This is the my-checklist app's front-end. Since this is the very beggining of the project we do not have an MVP yet. But the project aims to be a collaborative tool where you can create, edit and get checklists for everything you need! No matter if you're going to the beach or making a study plan we intend to help you as well.

## running the project in your local enviroment

Make sure to have `node` and `yarn` installed. Then open the terminal and go to the project's directory. There, run the following commands:

 - `yarn install`;
 - `yarn start`

 And you're good to go!
